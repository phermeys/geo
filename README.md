This is a crap site I slapped together back in 2016 that I used to learn how to dockerize a php website

I think I now know how to do this in multiple ways, huzzah.

The stuff in container was my first attempt where I made the app its own container

Now, I pull the php container and link it to the source

You can clone and then docker-compose up -d this
