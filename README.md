I once had this crap site I built, and I also needed to learn to docker.

I then learned how to dockerize a simple php web app.

Now, I'm using that to build a template so I can easily build a new php website.

You can clone, edit and move env.template to .env, and then docker-compose up -d this 

Also rm -r ./container to get rid of my old learning test crap, I just keep it for posterity.
